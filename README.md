# tdl-warmup-python


## 1. Requirements

- `Python 3.7` (note: support for `Python 2.x` has been dropped)
- `pip` (ensure it supports `Python 3.7`)

### Tip

Updating `python`

**via conda**

`$ conda install python=3.7`

Updating `pip`

**via pip**

`$ pip install --upgrade pip`

**via CLI (optional)**

```
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ python3.7 get-pip.py
```

`python 3.7` can be referenced as `python`, `python3` or `python3.7`. Similarly, `pip` under `python 3.7` can be referenced as `pip`, `pip3` or `pip3.7`. 

## 2. How to start

- Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open `lib/send_command_to_server.py`
- Read the comments as documentation, they will guide through the rest of the setup
